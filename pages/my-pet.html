    Cornelius was born on October 15, 2015. He is an Italian Greyhound/Dachshund mix. I love this lil guy to death. Cornelius was once a stray dog headed to the dumpster until my family stepped in to have him spared. No animal should endure this; kindness is an action much better to live life by. His unconditional love and overall cuteness has motivated me to help other animals in need.
